üéÆ Customer Retention & Monetization Analysis for Gaming App (SQL Project)

Overview

This project focuses on analyzing player behavior, retention, and monetization patterns for a mobile gaming app using SQL. The goal is to uncover insights that help improve user engagement, reduce churn, and maximize revenue.

Key Objectives:

- Calculate 7-day and 30-day retention rates to measure how many new players stay active over time.

- Analyze daily, weekly, and monthly active users (DAU, WAU, MAU) to understand user engagement.

- Compute stickiness ratio (DAU/MAU) to evaluate how often monthly users engage daily.

- Measure monetization metrics like ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) and ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paying User).

- Identify high-value users (‚Äúwhales‚Äù) contributing disproportionately to revenue.

- Conduct A/B test analysis to assess feature effectiveness.


Tools & Techniques:

- SQL: Used extensively to write complex queries with joins, window functions, CTEs, and aggregations.
  
- Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering: Handling dates, calculating intervals, and classifying users based on behavior.

- Business Intelligence: Translating raw data into actionable business insights.
 
- (Optional) Visualizations can be added with tools like Power BI or Tableau to supplement findings.

Business Impact:

This analysis provides crucial insights into player lifecycle and revenue drivers, enabling the business to:

- Tailor marketing and retention strategies by identifying at-risk users.
- Optimize monetization efforts by focusing on high-value customer segments.
- Evaluate product changes via A/B testing to improve player experience.

Deliverables:

- Organized SQL scripts segmented by retention, engagement, monetization, cohort, and A/B testing.
- A detailed README explaining the approach, queries, and key findings.
- (Optional) Visual dashboards or reports for enhanced storytelling.
